## Branch Management and Tagging
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.
###### 1. Using Markdown to create headings
To create headings, use the hash symbol at the begining of the line, the number of hash used indicate the level of the heading.
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
