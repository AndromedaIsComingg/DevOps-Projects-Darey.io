# Implementing Loadbalancers with Nginx

#### What is load balancing?
Load balancing is the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application. Modern applications must process millions of users simultaneously and return the correct text, videos, images, and other data to each user in a fast and reliable manner. To handle such high volumes of traffic, most applications have many resource servers with duplicate data between them. A load balancer is a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an invisible facilitator, ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.

##### The concept is shown by the illustration below

Nginx is a versertile software, it can act like a web server, reverse proxy, and a load balancer. All that is needed is to configure it properly for which purpose.

##### The concept of using Nginx as a load balancer is shown by the illustration below

#### The prerequisites for the implementation of Loadbalancers with Nginx on Linux are as follows:

- Stable network connection
- How to create an EC2 Instance
- Basic Unix command knowledge
- A system running Linux or an AWS EC2 instance running a Linux OS
- Access to the terminal
- A user account with sudo privileges


## Setting up a Basic Load Balancer

###### 1. Create and Configure two linux based server using the AWS EC2 console

Instance A name - `Apache Server`

Instance B name - `Nginx Loadbalancer`

###### 2. Creating Inbound Rules
For Instance A, the Sever, we will be opening port 8000 and port 80 will be openned for Instance B, the Load balancer. This will be done by creating a new entry in the "inbound rules" in the Instances' security group.
Instance a will also be configured to allow traffic from anywhere.
